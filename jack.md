1. Spectulus sent you to check on Jack, Spectulus' first intern, who was accidently transported into a parallel dimension. His alternate self still lives in Edron. Try to ask him about 'Spectulus'.
2. You have talked to Jack and found out that he is not remembering the time accident or Spectulus. Return to Spectulus in the Edron Academy to tell him about your findings.
3. Spectulus wants you to trigger Jack's memory. Jack used to like his red cushioned chair, an old globe, a telescope, a large amphora and a rocking horse. Place those in his room and ask him about it.
4. You redecorated Jack's house to match his old personality but his memory did not show any signs of recovery. Report back to Spectulus to find out what to do next.

6. You convinced Jack's mother and sister that he was working as an intern for Spectulus. Both now believe that he was acting in secrecy for selfish reasons. Return to Spectulus to report your success.
7. Spectulus suggested asking Jack about his hobbies. Make Jack leave his hobby be by whatever means it takes. Only by doing this he will be separated from what distracts him from his former self.
8. You found out and destroyed Jack's hobby. Jack is now finally ready and beginning to change. He even seems to start remembering Spectulus and the Academy.
