Player: SOLOSARASATIQUARIUM (Wrath of the Emperor - Mission 09: The Sleeping Dragon)
A Sleeping Dragon: Dragon dreams are golden. ...

A Sleeping Dragon: A broad darkness surrounds you as if a heavy curtain is closing before your eyes. After what seems like minutes of floating through emptiness, you get the feeling as if a hole opens in the dark before you. ...

A Sleeping Dragon: The hole grows larger, you cannot close your eyes. An unimaginable black. Deeper and darker than any nothingness you could possibly imagine drags you into it. ...

A Sleeping Dragon: You feel as if you cannot breathe anymore. The very second you let loose of your consciousness, you sense all heaviness around you lifted. ...

A Sleeping Dragon: You dive into an ocean of emerald light. Feeling like born anew the colour around you is almost overwhelming. Countless objects of all shapes and sizes are dashing past you. Racing against each other, millions are clashing in the distance. ...

A Sleeping Dragon: The loudness of the gargantuan spectacle around you bursts your hearing, yet you absorb all the sounds around you. ...

A Sleeping Dragon: As several large obstacles move aside directly in front of you, an intense bright centre leaps into your view. Though you cannot perceive how fast you are, your pace seems too slow. ...

A Sleeping Dragon: Ever decelerating, you ultimately approach a middle in this chaos of tones of green. ...

A Sleeping Dragon: As you come closer to it, yellowish shades of orange embrace you, softer shapes emerge and you almost forget the mayhem before. In warm comfort you see what lies in the heart of it all. ...

A Sleeping Dragon: A majestic dragon in his sleep is surrounded by what seems the warmth and energy of a thousand suns. The tranquillity of its sight makes you smile gently. ...

A Sleeping Dragon: You feel a perfect mixture of joy, compassion and sudden peacefulness. Bright xanthous impressions of topaz, orange and white welcome you at the final halt of your journey. ...

A Sleeping Dragon: Dragon dreams are golden. ...

A Sleeping Dragon: You find yourself inside the dragon's dream. You can look around or go into a specific direction. You can also take or use an object. Enter help to display this information at any time.

Balduin The Baker: Now once we've got enough ingredients to finish the bridge, we have to face another challenge. And that is the cake keep itself! Is is an almost impenetrable though edible fortress made completely out of cake! ...

Balduin The Baker: The thing is, to reach his secrets we will have to eat the whole cake! This is easier said than done though as the cake regenerates itself periodically with the help of magic. ...

Balduin The Baker: So we only have a few minutes to eat a whole layer of the cake, only then it will not regenerate but the upper layer will come down. So layer for layer we have to eat that cake. ...

Balduin The Baker: It will take an army of hungry Tibians to eat them all in time. Even then things have to be somewhat coordinated. ...

Balduin The Baker: People have to be brought here, wait for their turn to eat and of course stay hungry. Eating another layer might prove futile if you do not wait a few minutes for the hunger to return. ...

Balduin The Baker: The good thing is that all people, big and small, can participate. ...

Balduin The Baker: I guess the isle had a nice and flashy name in the past. But you know how people are. Someone started to call it the Cake Isle and I guess it is only a matter of time until this is shortened to CI. ...

Captain Dreadnought: Hohoh, one of the richest cities, filled with merchants and LOOT! Err. I mean, it is HIGHLY recommendable for unexperienced and first-time adventurers. Don't know why they built it over a stinking swamp though. I can sail there if you like.

Player: Liberty Bay
Dorian: There are many opportunities in Liberty Bay. The poor are eager allies against the rich, and the latter are often VERY rich. Still, the laws are quite strict, and poor or not, the locals are somewhat suspicious towards strangers.

Player: combinatorics
Doubleday: Besides the state of the altered glooth down there, I am trying to figure out more about the structure of the creatures this affects. This requires blood - in a certain combination! ...

Doubleday: See, down there in the upper parts of the new sewers, you can find three sorts of creatures. When I went down there the last time - and that was quite some time ago - I found a strange substance. ...

Doubleday: Undoubtedly blood - but not just any blood. It must have been a certain combination of everything that crawls down there. Believe it or not - it made a puddle of my altered glooth down there perfectly stable! ...

Doubleday: I couldn't find out the combination - but I took samples! See, this is like - mixing a certain cocktail, you need to put different liquids with different densities in a specific order to get the best effect, ahem heh heh, eh? ...

Doubleday: Well, don't you get it? If you can kill them in a specific order (which I will explain to you in DETAIL before), the mixed blood will be ideal for my research! ...

Doubleday: Sounds crazy, doesn't it? Well it isn't! If I can figure out what kind of monster combination made the altered glooth stable - there will be no shortage of altered glooth anymore! ...

Doubleday: With that being said - only combo chains (3x 3 creatures in a row and consecutive chains) will be rewarded! So, are you in or not or what?

Player: yes
Doubleday: Alright let's see! You didn't beat the total highscore of 630 with 210 consecutive chains. Only consecutive triple chains will count! ...

Doubleday: Remember that failing by killing enemies in the wrong order will completely RESET your current score and I will NOT be able to reward you. Your overall record will be stored, however. ...

Doubleday: Well keep trying - and most importantly, keep me informed!

Dronk: Mh, oh? It looks like YOU WANT to help, well then...?

Player: Groam
Dronk: Well, Groam is a friend. Groam and I already had that pestering pool all drained, but that didn't last long. SUDDENLY, we heard voices from down there, VOICES my friend. ...

Dronk: We didn't know what to do, so we started searching the mud. AND THEN, I had that sudden urge to just leave that place. ...

Dronk: PROBLEM IS, when I turned around to ask Groam about it, he just said something about an entrance and then he disappeared. ...

Dronk: So my buddy already went down there, but he did not return. Eventually the water came back and the voices stopped.

Player: machine / pump
Dronk: I don't understand the technomancers magic completely, but using coal on one of the three pumps down here will drain the water in the pool at the end of the tunnel. ...

Dronk: PROBLEM IS, when the water is drained, something seems to 'awake'. ...

Dronk: Hey stop looking like that, I know it's true, I don't make this up. I HEARD THEM. Alright, I heard them.

Player: problem
Dronk: As you might have noticed, the tunnel here is filled with water. We got the machines from the technomancers to pump the water out but our resources on coals are quite thin. ...

Dronk: Most coal is used for blacksmithing and something as unimportant as an inaccessible tunnel is not deemed worthy of our black gold you know. ...

Dronk: We KNOW it is no ordinary tunnel system down there though but we found some kind of ruins down there. PROBLEM IS, we had no spare time for exploring before the water drove us out. ...

Dronk: Now I really would love to get the machines running but first we have to gather enough coal to make them work.

Player: help / job
Dronk: I'm responsible to oversee the security and integrity of the mine tunnels. ...

Dronk: Ah right, and you can help me out here if you want. PROBLEM IS, you probably don't even know what you are doing here. ...

Dronk: See the pumps there? And the pool of water over there?

Player: yes
Dronk: Good, because that is part of the problem. AND THE PROBLEM IS, while these pumps are able to drain the water out of the pond over there, they only work for a limited time. ...

Dronk: They run on *coal* you see, COAL. And that's the one thing I just don't have down here right now. ...

Dronk: Yeah I know that I could mine some more or just loot some creature's corpse but I can't leave just yet. ...

Dronk: Still, even with that pool drained, I still need to find Groam and I surely won't leave without him.

Druid Yandur: Equip yourself well and gather some experience in the caves below. You may stay there for a while, but you should leave for the main continent soon. ...

Druid Yandur: The captain on the ship to the north will bring you to a city of your choice when you are prepared. Farewell, young druid, and don't hesitate to ask me if you have any questions.

Player: danger
Eathar: It seems our plant causes the some local wildlife of the underground to go mad for some odd reason. We have no idea what's happening but the attacks of the beasts are undeniable. ...

Eathar: The worst part is, that even creatures formerly unknown in this area, burrow their way to the plant. And some of these creatures are HUGE, I tell you

Player: HUGE
Eathar: The worst attacker is the occasional tremor worm as we have called them. They are enormous solitary beasts whose presence alone causes enough damage to threaten the stability of the plant. ...

Eathar: Their digging and moving underground send tremors to the delicate machines in the plant and they often destroy parts of our cooling system. ...

Eathar: This will sooner or later cause our systems to malfunction and some of them even to explode. ...

Eathar: Causing massive damage to the plant. The only way to stop them, is to kill them before they caused too much damage to our systems.

Gnomad: You will encounter quite a lot of beasties in the area ahead of us. The end of the cave-system is where the trouble begins though. The monsters here all serve some massive creature only known as Deathstrike. ...

Gnomad: The creature is hidden in a well protected chamber. The good news is, we've managed to erect a crystal structure close to the cave that is able to breach its defence and teleport someone into the chamber. ...

Gnomad: The bad news is that the crystals need a specific charge before they can work. As soon as the crystals begin to charge up, Deathstrike's minions will frenzy and spawn in waves to crush all opposition. ...

Gnomad: You will have to kill them quite fast, to not be overwhelmed by their numbers! Our own tries to breach the defence has proven that you'll have to endure six waves until the teleporter to Deathtstrikes' cave opens for a short 30 seconds. ...

Gnomad: Use the GREEN command crystal in the cave to begin the charging of the teleport! Good luck.

Gnomenezer: Don't tell me! Just a minute ... well while I think about it I can continue to explain your task to you. For the time being I'll call you a humus if need be. Now for your task, and this time please refrain from interrupting. ...

Gnomenezer: We have to get things done here, you know? However. The task is quite simple ... that is if ... no, wait, we had that already. So listen: ...

Gnomenezer: Plain and simple, so even a humus can understand it. Ahem, you don't mind being called a humus, do you? ...

Gnomenezer: It's only for the time being, as I said ... so now ... without further interruptions <gives you a stern look> you have to repair some of our crystal golems. ...

Gnomenezer: You know, they sometimes 'loose their music' as we say. The golems are controlled not by sentience but by complex melodies that dictate their actions. ...

Gnomenezer: The crystals vibrate in certain ways and react to certain vibrations in certain ways. I would explain it in more detail but I fear you could be a bit at a loss in face of gnomish crystallography. ...

Gnomenezer: In fact, I assume your head might explode if filled with too much gnomish knowledge. ...

Gnomenezer: So do you humus people have a brain in your heads like gnomes do, or is it in your stomach and your head more like a resonance body? I noticed you guys don't only have big feet but also quite loud voices. ...

Gnomenezer: Oh well, no time for that now. Please stick to the topic now. Or even better, just listen silently. So you might remember, golems, crystals, music etc.? ...

Gnomenezer: Well of course you do. So sometimes those golems get a disharmony by certain external effects beyond gnomish control. This is where you come into play. ...

Gnomenezer: You have been handed a resonance bell and now you have to use it on the confused golems. ...

Gnomenezer: That will not repair him of course, but resonate him into a call-back mode that will teleport him to the golem workshop. Simple enough, eh? I trust in you. Just do your humusly possible.

Gnominer: What an amazing discovery you made! This ... well it changes just everything. As soon as we figured out what you exactly found, we might put it to good use. ...

Gnominer: Still the volcanic activity is on the rise and we expect our old enemy, those below to be tampering with it. ...

Gnominer: If such a volcano erupts not only huge parts of the surface will be covered with lava, the cloud caused by the eruption might plunge you abovegrounders into eternal darkness. ...

Gnominer: For now there's little we can do about it though. The only lead our explorators have, are some magma crystals that seem to interact with the volcano in a dangerous way. ...

Gnominer: We have to figure out if we can reach these crystals with our gnomish heat shielding technology and how their destruction interacts with the environment. ...

Gnominer: Please help our researcher at the GT-M-01 site, he will tell you what to do.

Gnomish Operative (GT-M-01): Hello! Please let's hurry and proceed with the operation, so we can get out as soon as possible!

Player: name
Gnomish Operative (GT-M-01): If you are tardy you can call me gnomcrispy soon enough.

Player: job
Gnomish Operative (GT-M-01): I'm in the unfortunate position of overseeing this insanely hot part of our operation.

Player: news
Gnomish Operative (GT-M-01): The news is: HURRY!

Player: time
Gnomish Operative (GT-M-01): It seems it's some minutes before I'm 'well done'.

Player: operation
Gnomish Operative (GT-M-01): Let's go through this quick. In this cave we discovered certain magma crystals that are attuned to the volcanic core and seem to be part of the process that heats it up.

Player: crystals
Gnomish Operative (GT-M-01): The crystals must be destroyed. We hope that has a positive influence on the core's stability and heat level. ...

Gnomish Operative (GT-M-01): The problem is, they heat up the area around them to insane levels. ...

Gnomish Operative (GT-M-01): We can provide you with some gnomish heat protection. Just use the crystal machine to charge your shield. ...

Gnomish Operative (GT-M-01): The shield will begin to detoriate rapidly as soon as you are in the superheated area. ...

Gnomish Operative (GT-M-01): Better have an eye on your heat protection and plan your way back too. As soon as the shield runs out, you will take massive damage. ...

Gnomish Operative (GT-M-01): If your heatshield is low, better leave the superheated area and get a new shield charge. ...

Gnomish Operative (GT-M-01): It might take a few runs to get those pesky crystals destroyed. You need to destroy all three of them, so we can see if it does what our scientists expect.

Player: bye
Gnomish Operative (GT-M-01): Good bye.

Player: tactical
Gnomole: Since you are seasoned adventurers I'll skip the basics and jump right to the important part! This cave system is overrun by the minions of ... ah well, the greatest shame of gnomekind. ...

Gnomole: That traitorous gnome, known as Gnomevil, who was my pupil before his changeover to the dark side of gnomedom, has abandoned all gnomish ethics and joined forces with our enemies. ...

Gnomole: It's hard to tell what led to his downfall. In the end he seems to have forgotten the principle that with small stature comes great responsibility. ...

Gnomole: He became tainted and corrupted by evil, obviously enough to grow in size, which is always an indicator for evil of course. ...

Gnomole: Now he commands his armies in the name of those below and hides in his lair protected by layers of thick crystal that only he can form and change due to his corrupted powers! ...

Gnomole: There is one thing though that could cause his downfall! His corruption has spread to his minions and in his lair there are some infected weepers that are full of parasites. ...

Gnomole: These parasites will spread a fluid that will weaken the integrity of the crystals in front of Gnomevils lair when they die. The entrance is marked with crystal columns, so you can't miss it. ...

Gnomole: You have to kill enough of the parasites DIRECTLY in front of the crystals. Eventually the columns will collapse and allow you entrance to Gnomevils lair. ...

Gnomole: Take care though, due to Gnomevils power the crystals will grow back quite fast. Better manage the parasites in quick succession or everything will be for naught. ..., Enter his lair and bring an end to his despicable reign!

Player: dr merlay / father
Graham: I know you wish to give me hope, but my father is dead. I have heard many things about him in the last fifteen years, but to believe THAT? Impossible. I have accepted, with a quiet heart now, that he died for his science.

Grombur: It's a crystal mine. Very rare crystals can be found here. We mine them and produce all kind of precious things out of them. Well, not me. I'm too clumsy for this kind of work so, they PROMOTED me to a guard! ...

Grombur: I'm a good guard, no one without permission is allowed to enter.

Player: combined magic winterberry society
Gruffy: The Combined Magical Winterberry Society was founded more than one hundred years ago by mage Tolwyn Winter. ...

Gruffy: It is our duty to ensure the harvesting and processing of winterberries to secure a steady flow of the appropriate magical resources for potions and other magical fluids in this world. ...

Gruffy: What? No, all further information is on a... a 'need to know' basis. Where? No! That's not - I mean I won't tell you where our... IF we even HAVE any headquarters.

Player: mission
Gruffy: Alright, first thing is | [repeat] Alright, then here we go again. - you deliver your berries and put them into one of the moulds over there. We need to fill the vat with berries before the actual treading can start. ...

Gruffy: When enough winterberries have been put into the moulds, the vat is full and the treading starts. When this time has come, everyone needs to enter the vat and start TREADING like they never trod before. ...

Gruffy: It's possible that you may have to deal with the berry pest, a whole swarm of small flying buggers who will try to feed on the winterberries. ...

Gruffy: If that happens, you will have to remove them. All of them, or the treading cannot continue. ...

Gruffy: Depending on the state of the berries, you will need to add water or sugar to the mix after some time. I will tell you which, just listen to me when the time comes. ...

Gruffy: Whenever you want to return to Thais, simply ask me to transport you back. And that's basically it. All clear or do you want me to repeat it?

Player: mission
Grumpy Stone: As much as I dislike admitting it: I need help. WE need help. See, when we arrived in this part of the world, we quickly realised that we can't linger here while keeping our true forms. We need to take over animals, plants or stones. ...

Grumpy Stone: And we had to hurry. Some of my siblings were luckier than us and had the chance to take over animals like deer, birds or squirrels. We had to choose these stones and now we are stuck here. ...

Grumpy Stone: I don't know for how long and with this issue you can't help us, I'm afraid. But there is something else, a trifle compared to our main problem. Nonetheless, it is annoying. ...

Grumpy Stone: As for myself I'm fine but my sisters and brothers surrounding us are not. Their backs are itching terribly and we don't have arms and hands to scratch ourselves. Would you help us and scratch my siblings' backs to bring them some relief?

Player: Eclesius
Guide Elena: You might consider working for the wizard Eclesius who asked us for some talented help. He created a magic portal on the beach in front of our headquarter. USE it to instantly travel to his homestead.

Player: wand / rod
Hamish: Wands and rods are a magic user's weapon of choice! You can distinguish a specific weapon by its name: WANDS are used by SORCERERS, and DRUIDS use RODS. Simply equip one and aim at a monster to shoot. Mana will be consumed with each shot. ...

Hamish: A sorcerer can't use a rod, and a druid can't use a wand. Simple, really. When you advance some more levels, check back to see if you can buy a new wand or rod that would make more damage!...

Hamish: Each wand or rod makes a specific type of damage, which is useful to know if you're hunting monsters which may be immune or weak to a certain element! ...

Hamish: Traditionally, druid rods focus on ice or earth damage, whereas sorcerer wands deal death, fire or energy damage. Here on Dawnport, the druids deal ice damage with their chiller, while the sorcerers wield the fire-dealing scorcher. ...

Player: Menesto
Inigo: Hasn't been with us for very long. Very interested in all things mystical, so Menesto was sent down to guard the strange crystal portal we found here. ...

Inigo: ... But of course, you met him. ... So it really is a portal, and you came through it from another plane of existence! I never quite believed the tales of old, not really. But now... it's wonderful, truly wonderful. ...

Inigo: Well, if you have any questions as to THIS plane of existence, which we call Tibia, just ask me. I can give directions, hints, you name it. <winks at you>

Player: NPC / talk
Inigo: NPC means someone like me or Hamish or Coltrayne, for example. You can easily discern us from players like you, because there is a speech bubble next to our name. ...

Inigo: We all have our different ways, but normally, addressing an NPC with 'hi' or 'hello' will open a conversation. ...

Inigo: Some NPCs will have secret words that they react to that are not highlighted in their conversation. In that case, you need to type in your question. ...

Inigo: To do so, open the NPC Chat Channel and click on the empty space below the NPCs dialogue, and start typing. ...

Inigo: You can try this out by asking an NPC about their job, as this is a keyword most will react to. If you have any other questions, tell me.

Player: play
Inigo: Our world Tibia is swarmed by many dangerous monsters, so fighting is something you will have to learn and master quickly. You can fight as a sorcerer, druid, paladin or knight. ...

Inigo: We need your help in keeping the monsters at bay - walk out of one of the four gates here, and you will receive one of the four vocations and its gear to try out and fight monsters. ...

Inigo: Dawnport is just a small, but dangerous island. You will have to reach level 8 at least and choose your definite vocation before you can leave for the mainland. To reach level 8, you will have to fight some monsters in order to progress. ...

Inigo: Fighting is essential in Tibia, and though Dawnport is quite safe in comparison to the mainland, be careful not to die, as dying HURTS. ...

Inigo: If you have any other questions, tell me.

Player: rope
Inigo: You should never leave without a rope. NEVER. A rope can save your life. I once fell down into a poison spider lair - without a rope, I wouldn't be standing here today! ...

Inigo: You can buy a rope over at Richard's shop. If you don't have the money, kill and loot a few monsters - maybe one of them even has a rope with it, that sort of thing happens.

Knight Hykrion: Each item has a certain weight. Capacity determines how much resources and other things you can carry around with you. With each character level, you can carry a little bite more. Experienced knights can carry A LOT.

Player: distance
Knight Hykrion: Although we have some attacks which we can use from a distance, this is not our main strength. Close combat is what we are best at. How about weapons? From the following weapon types, pick one that is NOT usually used by knights: sword, axe or bow?

Player: close
Knight Hykrion: Very good! Do not fear standing close to the action! As long as you have healing available, you won't fall easily. What about weapons? From the following weapon types, pick one that is NOT usually used by knights: sword, axe or bow?

Player: (any)
Knight Hykrion: No, no, please stick to the options that I gave you. What is NOT used by knights: sword, axe or bow?

Player: sword

Lucius: You need to travel to these places within a day after I gave you a magical torch. I summoned a lightbearer's basin there, similar to those here in the temple. ...

Lucius: You have to use the torch on a basin to power its light. Then it will have regain enough energy to burn brightly for another two hours. ...

Lucius: If you look at a basin, you can see how much energy there is still left. As long as all fire basins are burning, no creatures will be able to enter Tibia. ...

Lucius: However, when only one fire basin turns dark and disappears, powerful demons will be unleashed onto this world. ...

Lucius: You have to keep the fire burning for five days, and on the last day the demons will be so weakened that you can dispose of them easily when they come. ...

Lucius: I can give you only one torch which lasts for a day and will then disappear. Also, you can only use your torch ONCE on each basin. ...

Lucius: Thus you need to work together with your fellow Tibians, so that someone can always keep the fire basins burning, on each of the five days. ...

Player: malor
Nah'Bob: Now THAT djnn really means stress. Too bad that doofus of an orc king freed him from his prison in the lamp. Gabel should have gotten rid of Malor for good when had the chance to do so.

Player: hi (Bank Robbery MWC)
Naji: HELP! We have been robbed! I can't give you any gold until the robber has been brought to justice or we have received a compensation from the king. I think the robbers ran towards the Ancient Temple.

Player: hi (Bank Robbery MWC - having Bag with Stolen Gold)
Naji: I'm sorry, but we have been robb- hey, what's that bag? Have you hunted down the bank robbers?

Player: job
Nathaniel: I am a fan and want to inform other Tibians about the BEST colour to join, the best wizard, the great CAUSE! NATURE! Wizard Fern, whose colour is green of course!

Player: yes
Navigator: I was once captain of a ship, the Skyflare. We were traders for King Tibianus and on our way home when we got into a storm. We fought hard to escape the cold grip of the sea. ...

Navigator: I myself did what I could to navigate the Skyflare out of this mess. They depended on me. Me, the navigator. And I succeeded. ...

Navigator: However, when the sea calmed down and the rain was finally gone, we recognised that our ship wouldn't move. It wasn't my fault. ...

Navigator: There was a strong gale and we could already see this island on the horizon. There were seagulls all around the Skyflare to lead us to dry land. But the ship did not move a single inch. It was NOT my fault. ...

Navigator: We dived under the bow and saw that it was stuck right on the tip of a sharp rock. The world below us was treacherous, we could see large underwater mountains and a labyrinthine system of caves and holes. ...

Navigator: Some of my men panicked and hijacked the dinghies to reach the island, others tried to swim. I remained on the ship. It was not my FAULT. It was not. ...

Navigator: Do you have enough, can I stop?

Player: yes
Navigator: Of course you do. And they did, too. They obeyed me. They adored me. They followed me. ...

Navigator: I learnt everything about their culture, their life, their goals and their problems. I found out about vile insect-like creatures inhabiting the surface of the island. And their waiting for the return of Qjell. ...

Navigator: I practically rewrote their history. I WAS THE SECOND COMING. I WAS QJELL. I, THE NAVIGATOR. ...

Navigator: And I navigated them out of their miserable lives. Away from their petty interests. I led them to a greater purpose - to form chaos out of order, to bring back the storm to the seas and to make THINGS MOVE. Do you want to hear the rest as well?

Player: no
Navigator: Hahaaaahahaa... YOU are not even WORTHY!

Player: yes
Navigator: I control EVERYTHING from this room, navigating the fate of this land for more than a century now. Can you see all these funnels? My voice travels through them and throughout everything down here! ...

Navigator: The stones on the beach? The trader up there? That was ME ALL THE TIME! I lured YOU into creating all this chaos up there and down here! ...

Navigator: You thought you could choose sides? Think again! I nearly led you into the destruction of two species! ME, THE NAVIGATOR! I CONTROL YOU, I OWN YOU! QJELL AFAR GOU JEY!

Player: helmet
Navigator: NAAAAARGH. If you promise to leave me alone and NOT TO TELL MY SECRET to anyone - you can have one. ...

Navigator: NO! Not the one I'm wearing. I am BOUND to this device. This suit has granted me a longer life. However, once you have spent a certain time with this - there is no turning back if you know what I mean. ...

Navigator: The armor will merge with your very body. Holding you captive, holding your life in its hands like a ransom. ...

Navigator: Using Deepling craft and various components from down here, I created several spare helmets - just in case this one gets damaged. If you return that small golden anchor to me, you can have one. Will you?

Player: yes
Navigator: Then take this one. And remember: DO NOT TELL ANYONE ABOUT ME OR ANYTHING YOU HAVE HEARD HERE TODAY.

Neill: Indeed! As you will have to choose your vocation soon, this festival will help you decide by showing you each vocation's unique style and techniques. ...

Neill: In each tent, a combat trainer will show you his vocation's special fighting technique. So you can find out which vocation suits you best! ...

Neill: Don't worry, it's all for fun, just to show you the principle, and won't hurt. OK?

Player: nalus murtu
Nemal: Thank you! NALUS MURTUUU! ... I can see again! To show you, how grateful I am, I'll give you a key. Be wise when using it. I can't tell you, where it matches, but ... take good care, it is useless without mental powers!

Noozer: Yes, yes. Or wait - why do you want to.. ah what does it matter. So you want to get through these caves, fine. But be warned! ...

Noozer: ...wait a second, I lost it. What was I going to say again? Ah yes - DANGEROUS! These. Caves. Are. Dangerous. No way you get out alive. Ever. Again. ...

Noozer: Also you should not disturb those... people down there. Yeah. They... hm, wait, they - who are they again? Hey! Who are you? Are you talking to me?! Ah, ah... oh yes, I remember. ...

Noozer: Wait - I am the guardian here, yes! The keeper of... something... or another, yes, I... guard this place. With my life. Don't I? Of course! ...

Noozer: Is, er... this the moment where I should try to... stop you? Yes? No? Ah, you know what - you go down there, those guys are angry as dung anyway. Try your luck, return to me when you're done. If you still can. Or not.

Player: thank you
Norma: Oh no, I have to thank YOU for being here!

Player: mission
Norman The Foreman: Looking for some fancy adventure? I heard the Agency of Venorean Interest Negotiators always need adventurers willin' to help ensure the safety o' Venore and its ventures. ...

Norman The Foreman: The AVIN office is in the harbour building, second floor. Ask for Uncle.

Player: yes
Norman The Foreman: Good. The charlatan outpost is at the southern production site; I put up a warning sign. Enter their cave through the hidden mud hole, next to the ropespot. ...

Norman The Foreman: Inside, kill five little charlatans so they get the message to STAY OFF our property. Come back when you've succeeded.

Oswald: You know a rumour? TELL ME! TELL ME! TELL ME!

Player: sword
Paladin Narai: Uhhh... no. Although we CAN use swords, we're not that good at it, so you should stick to bows and throwing weapons. One more question! Which magic is exclusively for paladins? Is it death, holy or fire?

Player: Jail/Cell
Partos: You mean this is a JAIL? They told me it's the finest hotel in town! THAT explains the lousy room service!

Player: Eclesius

Pemaret: WOW! You have a marlin!! I could make a nice decoration for your wall from it. May I have it?

Player: cult
Percy Silverhand: Nonsense! I do not want to hear these old women's tales again! Although some sinister cult would perfectly fit those natives here, there IS no such a thing as a secret cult.

Player: yes
Pig: Uh. Uhm. That was ... unskilled. Sorry, you have to learn MUCH about kissing.

Player: yes
Pig: Uhhh. Well, that was ... promising. But you are FAR from being the best kisser in the land.

Player: yes
Pig: Mhmm. Nice try. You definitely have some experience but you should improve your skill DRASTICALLY.

Player: yes
Pig: Mhmmm. Oh my, you have learnt a few tricks indeed. But it takes more to become the best kisser in the world. FAR more.

Player: yes
Pig: Mhm Uhhh. Not bad, not bad at all! But you can still improve your skill a LOT.

Player: yes
Pig: Ahhh. That was really nice. But you STILL lack the refinement of perfection.

Player: femur
Pino: You are probably talking about the FEMOR hills.

Pyro Peter: Job? JOB? This is not a simple job, I'm here to WARN people, to HELP the citizens of Venore! They just won't listen to me...

Player: News
Pyro Peter: FIRE!! All of Shadowthorn is in flames! ...

Pyro Peter: With all their overseers dead and the legions of followers in the era severely diminished, the firestarters got away. The elves BURN!! But these are no ordinary fires!! ...

Pyro Peter: The fires lit by the firestarters are fuelled by their hate, their intolerance and anger - only water from the bog can extinguish such mayhem. ...

Pyro Peter: We must go there and fight the fire to redeem ourselves and save Venore from the ever devastating flames!

Rafzan: Oh, so thankful me be! Use this container in the correct order on the following: ...

Rafzan: First, FRESH snail slime from a slain snail. Any snail you find will do. You will have to wait a little before its corpse will allow you to gather the slime. ...

Rafzan: Second, add a sample black swamp gas that can be found in some remote areas of the swamp. ...

Rafzan: Third, the fart of a rotworm. Rotworms eat the strangest things and their farts have a special ... odour. Use the container on a living rotworm. With some luck you catch a fart. ...

Rafzan: Last, you need to use the container on mouldy cheese, this is what ratmen love most! You might find some in possession of goblins. If you are done, return the container to me.

Player: busy
Rafzan: Ratmen always bickering and fighting each other. Keeps them occupied from stealing me stuff and makes them want to buy better stuff from me than the other ratmen have. ...

Rafzan: Me need you to ... place some stuff of hostile rat clan in rat cave to make them angry. ...

Rafzan: But ratmen are STRONG and DANGEROUS!!! (Not recommended for levels below 35) Better not go alone when you are inexperienced. Are you helping poor me?

Player: destroy
Rafzan: Ratmen often make deal with poor me. Sad story short, they always make profit, me never. If stuff they buy is destroyed, they have to buy new stuff. I need you to destroy stuff they bought from me. ...

Rafzan: But ratmen are STRONG and DANGEROUS!!! (Not recommended for levels below 35) Better not go alone when you are inexperienced. Are you helping poor me?

Player: yes
Rafzan: Oh, so thankful me be! You must kill five of this horrible goblin hut gnawers to teach them a lesson! CAN YOU HEAR ME MARSH STALKERS?! SWEET GOBLIN REVENGE IS ON ITS WAY!

Player: truth / danger
Rapanaio: When I found that ancient text, warning of the Isle of Evil, I tried to tell the world about it. But the forces of evil discovered my plans! They made people assume it was just another tale for children. ...

Rapanaio: THEY distributed a book of children's bedtime stories with a copy of the text in it to undermine my message! Their despicable ruse worked and they made a laughing stock of me! Of course I knew it was a plot to discredit me. ...

Rapanaio: On the other hand, it was obvious that THEY now knew about me and the text I possessed. I went into hiding in fear of my life! THEY have tried to assassinate me! I must be constantly vigilant!

Player: text
Rapanaio: You'll find it in one of my chests. It's only a copy of course. The original is safely hidden! As much as THEY claim it's only a children's tale I know it's the truth.

Player: children's tale
Rapanaio: Bah, THEY forged a children's book that made my source material look like some part of it. Of course it is an evil plot to prevent me from locating the isle and slaying its dark master. ...

Rapanaio: Or rather, sending some other hero who will fight the ultimate evil in its own lair on my behalf. Someone has to stay and fight the fight on the mainland, of course.

Player: assassinate
Rapanaio: My life is no longer safe. The first attempt on my life was at a party thrown by a fellow inventor. THEY put poison in one of the twenty pints of beer I drank that night. ...

Rapanaio: The following morning I was close to death. Only my strong dwarven constitution stood between me and the grim reaper that day. ...

Rapanaio: In their next attempt, assassins tinkered with the stairs in front of my favourite tavern. When I was leaving the tavern after a night with my friends I tripped and fell, nearly breaking my neck! ...

Rapanaio: Only my catlike reflexes saved my life that time. Well, my reflexes and my beard that absorbed some of the force of the fall. ...

Rapanaio: Other attempts on my life followed! Like the object that was hurled at me while I was singing and dancing on the bar while at a party. ...

Rapanaio: And the list goes on and on. I know that I am in grave danger and I will not lie to you about the danger you will be in when THEY learn about you.

Player: THEY
Rapanaio: THEY are the servants of evil. THEY are everywhere and could be anyone. In fact, it has crossed my mind that most of THEM don't know who THEY are. Uhm, well, I mean THEY don't even know each other. The lure of evil is powerful. ...

Rapanaio: Most people are not as strong as you and me and easily give in to the lure of wealth and power that evil promises. ...

Rapanaio: Uhm, what was that flicker in your eyes? Well, anyway, Evil recruits its minions from all weak willed creatures so you can't be sure who is your enemy. ...

Rapanaio: I advise you to be cautious. Better safe than sorry. Or dead.

Player: inventor
Rapanaio: <lowers his voice> Sorry, that information is strictly classified. THEY might capture and torture you to find out what you know.

Player: Isle of Evil
Rapanaio: Psht, not that loud! But as your memory is so short, I will tell you of my researches once again! ...

Rapanaio: After constructing an evil-o-meter I set about finding places where evil was concentrated. It reacted as expected to places of great evil like the Ghostlands, the Plains of Havoc and the Edron ruins. ...

Rapanaio: But then it found somewhere new. My surprise knew no bounds when it showed a remote isle previously thought to be uninhabited. I am sure that something evil lurks there. Some unspeakable horror waiting to kill and devour unsuspecting travellers. ...

Rapanaio: I could not let that happen! So I did some research and as I was about to give up I stumbled upon an ancient text that told of the Isle of Evil! ...

Rapanaio: Immediately, the nature of the threat I had discovered became alarmingly clear! All I needed was a hero and some transport. But would they listen?! NO! They laughed at me. ...

Rapanaio: Well, that was where you stepped in. Now we have joined forces to save the world!

Player: resistance

Rehon: Get me out of here NOW!! And don't you dare to complain about the rhyme!

Player: squirrel / eat / cheese / ham
Richard: Don't talk to ME about squirrels! <shudders> Had to live off them the first days, when they were the only thing to go into my self-made acorn traps. Nasty. ...

Richard: Can't get rid of horrible dreams of giant squirrels hunting me, now.

Player: dawnport
Richard: This island here's not too bad. Once I didn't have to live off squirrels, it became quite enjoyable. Nasty things live underground though, so take care where you tread and ALWAYS have a rope with you! ...

Richard: Some of the others have been down there, didn't come out without several deep wounds each time. Mr Morris however is quite keen to find out more about the strange magical energies and the monsters deep down.

Player: hi
Riddler: Player! HEHEHEHE! Another fool visits the tower! Excellent!

Player: yes
Riddler: FOOL! Now you're doomed! But well ... So be it! Let's start out with the Seal of Knowledge and the first question: What name did the necromant king choose for himself?

Player: goshnar
Riddler: HOHO! You have learned your lesson well. Question number two then: Who or what is the feared Hugo?

Player: demonbunny
Riddler: HOHO! Right again. All right. The final question of the first seal: Who was the first warrior to follow the path of the Mooh'Tah?

Player: Tha'kull
Riddler: HOHO! Lucky you. You have passed the first seal! So ... would you like to continue with the Seal of the Mind?

Player: old
Riddler: ARGH! You did it again! Well all right. Do you wish to break the Seal of Madness?

Player: yes
Riddler: GOOD! So I will get you at last. Answer this: What is your favourite colour?

Player: green
Riddler: UHM UH OH ... How could you guess that? Are you mad??? All right. Question number two: What is the opposite?

Player: none
Riddler: NO! NO! NO! That can't be true. You're not only mad, you are a complete idiot! Ah well. Here is the last question: What is 1 plus 1?

Player: any number
Riddler: WRONG!

Riddler: NO! NO! NO! That can't be true. You're not only mad, you are a complete idiot! Ah well. Here is the last question: What is 1 plus 1?

Player: number from a prisoner, see quest log
Riddler: DAMN YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!

Player: stranded
Robson: I was on a steamship to sell some wares in Edron. On the boat was a drunken human mage who all of a sudden thought he could speed up our trip by conjuring some winds. ...

Robson: Not that a steamship would have sails or that something like this would make sense in an underground cavern! But such thoughts did not occur to that drunken fool and soon we had some veritable STORM in our underground cave ! ...

Robson: The storm tore the steamship apart and I tied myself to a plank and drifted in the water for what felt like days. Then I finally reached that isle here. ...

Robson: I fought the inhabitants of the isle and my axe earned me some respect I guess. At least they no longer bothered me over here. Using some wreckage, I built my first hut here. ...

Robson: I was living on fish, mushrooms and some hunted meat. My only light source were some luminescent mushrooms. ...

Robson: First I thought I could not stand it for a month but when I was eventually found by an exploring steamship, I felt that I no longer wanted to leave at all. ...

Robson: Of course I ordered some resources that I had missed all those years. I also ordered building materials to build a real hut. And guess what happened? ...

Robson: They sent me PARCELS! I mean I was lost for years, all that I wanted was some decent wood to have a real home and they sent me PARCELS! ...

Robson: What did they think I was going to do with them? Build a castle or what? However, the next shipment brought me the correct material and I could finally build a decent home. ...

Robson: By the way, if you need a parcel just ask me. I have to get rid of a few thousand.

Player: job
Rock Steady: Besides standing around here at the beach all day? Well, we actually spend a lot of time here at the beach. You could say ALL DAY. AND NOW LEAVE ME ALONE.

Player: collect
Rock Steady: I collect everything that reflects light in strange ways. However, I am bored by my collection. And there wasn't anything new to add for years. ...

Rock Steady: I like pearls for example - but I have already enough. I also like shells - but I can't even count how many I already own. ...

Rock Steady: If you find anything of REAL VALUE - bring it to me. I will reward you well. You don't already have something for me by chance?

Player: first visitor
Rock in a Hard Place: Bah, ask one of the pebbles on the beach about that. What I can tell you is that YOU are not the first.

Player: job
Roderick: I am ambassador of our beloved king, Tibianus III.

Player: story [repeated]
Roswitha: They say Alaistar Stanton married a minotaur princess and brought their child with him when the minotaurs would not accept a human as king. Can you believe that? <shakes head>

Roswitha: Did you know? That friendly Mr Barnabas Dee is a soothsayer who's foretold many things for this city! If only he had foretold Mr Brandon's death, maybe my poor husband would not have sailed. <shakes head>

Roswitha: Some say glooth does all kinds of strange things to you. Some claim it made them light as air and they could fly! Though I guess that's a whiff of peppermoon pollen too many, poor souls. Still, who knows. Try a pint of glooth for yourself! <winks>

Roswitha: No one has ever seen Azalea's face, she's always hooded. Some say she is hideously disfigured from a curse that she can't lift, always searching for a cure and that's why she became a druid and doesn't dare show her face, poor thing!

Roswitha: There's a phantom of the old opera, underneath the sewers. It stalks the city at night. Some of my customers have seen it! They say it looks like a horrible beast, moaning and roaring! <shudders>

Roswitha: You know they say some poor souls have been captured and made to work inside metal bodies and that's how gargoyles were made? I hope Mr Brandon's soul was not captured by one of those fellows!

Roswitha: Some say Rathleton was built on the ruins of an ancient order, some say, on a demonic site, and that the mists arising are the souls of the dead ... <shudders> I don't want to believe THAT, though!

Roswitha: I have been told that a weird scientist blew up the old factory to run from his debts, and that he's now hiding in one of your towns, gambling and drinking. For shame!

Roswitha: Flint used to be the city watch captain. But when he lost his best friend in a battle against the minotaurs, he resigned and became a blacksmith instead. Poor man!

Roswitha: My grandfather used to tell me the mists around this isle were the breath of sleeping dragons, who only breathe out every ten years. Now that would be a sight to see!

Player: mission
Rotem Valos: Our mission is to support young adventurers on their way to glory. By the way, 'mission' is a word you will use quite often in Tibia. All over the world, there are people that might have a mission for you. ...

Rotem Valos: Talking to the inhabitants is the best way to learn what bothers them. They will often respond if you simply ask for a mission. ... Certain missions will require some experience, so sometimes you will have to return later on. ...

Rotem Valos: You might consider working for the wizard Eclesius who asked us for some talented help. ... He created a magic portal on the beach outside our headquarters. USE it to instantly travel to his home. Of course there are other things you can do, too.

Player: death
Rotem Valos: Death is always a threat. When you are resurrected in the temple, you will find you might have lost quite a lot of your equipment. You might want to try to retrieve the more valuable stuff from your dead body. ...

Rotem Valos: Your dead body will take a while before it decays, and can be looted - by anyone. But before you run off into danger, remember: You will need a ROPE or a shovel to reach certain spots. ...

Rotem Valos: It is likely that you lost your rope when you died, so you might need to replace it. For this purpose, it might be a good idea to have stashed some basic equipment in your depot. ...

Rotem Valos: This will spare you valuable time when you hurry back to your corpse. Remember that each city has its own depot! ...

Rotem Valos: Another thing that you can do to prevent some of your losses in case of death, is to acquire blessings at certain temples.

Player: no
Rotem Valos: OK, then not.

Player: Hunters/Hunt
Rottin Wood: Aaaaah the thrill of the hunt. The wind in the forest making the trees talk to you. The glistening water of the rivers and lakes... you cannot get enough of it, can you? OUCH! Fir cone... again... I hate this... ah, nevermind.

Player: News
Rottin Wood: Some random fool came here and started getting on everyone's nerves. Oh wait, you're HERE. Hmph.

Player: no / ready
Salbra: (no) Hmm. But you really need to hear this: (ready) Lovely! There are two types of casting magic: spells and runes. Runes are magic spells stored in special stones. To cast a spell, you need to have learned the spell first. To use a rune, you only need to use the rune. ...

Salbra: But only DRUIDS and SORCERERS have a high enough MAGIC LEVEL to use spells or runes properly ...

Salbra: Now, spells, they have to be learned before you can use them. Later on, you will have to find your specific spell teachers, but for now, I know some fine spells to teach you the principle. Ready?

Player: no
Salbra: Aww, come on. You need to hear this. Your new spell can be cast anytime by saying 'exevo dis flam hur'. But I can show you a much more convenient way. First, open your spell list in the general controls menu, OK?

Player: no
Salbra: No isn't the answer I want to hear. Next, please select the spell 'Practise fire wave'. OK?

Player: no
Salbra: No isn't the answer I wanted to hear. Well then, drag and drop this spell onto a hotkey on the quickbar that's underneath your game window. OK?

Player: ready
Salbra: Your new spell can be cast anytime by saying 'exevo dis flam hur'. But I can show you a much more convenient way. First, open your spell list in the general controls menu, OK?

Player: ok
Salbra: Good. Next, please select the spell 'Practise fire wave'. OK?

Player: ok
Salbra: Good. Now, drag and drop this spell onto a hotkey on the quickbar that's underneath your game window. OK?

Player: no
Salbra: Come on, we're almost done. You see that typiong a spell works also. And now, please select the spell 'exura dis' in your spell list in the general controls menu, OK?

Player: no
Salbra: We're almost done, stay with me please. Drag and drop the spell onto a hotkey on the quickbar that's underneath your game window, OK?

Player: no
Salbra: I didn't hear that! BAM! Now heal yourself! ...

Salbra: If it doesn't work, please make sure you have the right settings and enough mana. There's a mana potion in the chest, just in case you need it. ...

Salbra: It worked, yes?

Player: no
Salbra: Not? But now you can of course use some healing spells on OTHERS, too. But keep in mind, ONLY A DRUID can HEAL OTHERS with a SPELL. Why would you want this? Well, other players will want to have you in their party if you are a druid! ...

Salbra: Now that was about all I had to tell you. Please proceed east and then north through the Gate of Initiates! ...

Salbra: Good luck, and find a vocation that suits your style at the 4 vocation trainers: Sorcerer Estrella, Knight Hykrion, Druid Yandur and Paladin Narai! ...

Salbra: One more thing: you can always skip this tutorial by saying 'skip tutorial' to any of us here at this festival. Good bye!

Player: ready
Salbra: That's easy, you have just learned 'exura dis', an easy healing spell. Now, type in the spell's magic words, 'exura dis', in your chatbar, OK?

Player: ok
Salbra: Great, you see that works too! And now please select the spell 'exura dis' in your spell list in the general controls menu, OK?

Player: ok
Salbra: Great, now please drag and drop the spell onto a hotkey on the quickbar that's underneath your game window, OK?

Player: ok
Salbra: BAM! Now heal yourself! ...

Salbra: If it doesn't work, please make sure you have the right settings and enough mana. There's a mana potion in the chest, just in case you need it. ...

Player: prospect
Sandomo: We are here to explore and prospect this desecrated shard of the gods creation. ...

Sandomo: This island is currently in a state of demonic stranglehold. Yet, the Inquisition WILL win this land back from the grasp of evil. ...

Sandomo: In my position as of the righteous Inquisition, I hereby declare you adjutant of the Inquisition - basically that means you are under MY command now.

Player: repairs
Sandomo: Alright, so you mixed and delivered 0 mortar and ...

Sandomo: You killed 0 frazzlemaws and ...

Sandomo: You also hunted 1 silencers. That would equal 1 of inquisition gold - BUT we are currently short of this valuable metal so... do you want me to add this amount to my books for now or trade it for something else.

Player: destroying
Sandomo: So, it seems you sounded 0 horns at the great mural and ...

Sandomo: You desecrated 0 shrines of the maws that roam these lands. And ...

Sandomo: You also lured 0 silencers away from the that cursed wall. Oh yes and ...

Sandomo: You actually eradicated 0 of the wretched eyeballs, Sight of Surrender. ...

Sandomo: That would equal 0 of inquisition gold - BUT we are currently short of this valuable metal so... do you want me to add this amount to my books for now or trade it for something else.

Player: No
Seymour: HEY! You don't have one! Stop playing tricks on me or I will give some extra work!

Player: requirements
Sharon: Well, first of all you need to purchase a Character World Transfer in the in-game Store. Without that, nothing will happen! ...

Sharon: Then choose the character and the world you wish to be transferred to and follow the instructions from the store. ...

Sharon: The character - you - must then talk to me here to be transferred to the chosen world. ...

Sharon: You MUST NOT have a black or red skull, also make sure that you do not have any open Tibia Coin auctions in the Market! ...

Sharon: You MUST give up all your bonds to this world. No marriage. No guild. No house. All of this will automatically be dissolved for you when transferring. ...

Sharon: You can only move every 6 months! So if you've already changed worlds, you need to wait 6 months for a new transfer. Or buy an Express World Transfer in the Store. But that's expensive. ...

Sharon: I can tell you about what happens to your money and items, and I also check whether you meet the requirements - and if you do, I can then teleport you to the departure platform.

Player: money
Sharon: I recommend depositing all of your gold in the bank. You will keep ALL of the money on your bank account on the new world.

Player: breasts / busty
Sirik: NOT ME! With that thick fur clothes we are wearing, it is not easy to see... er... female characteristics.

Player: army
Sirik: Good idea, how many people do we need for an army? Maybe you can recruit a few hundreds of your friends? *GIGGLE*

Player: robert
Sirik: HAA, he thinks his weapons are the best!! Too weak to hold a real barbarian axe! You find him near the arena.

Player: raiders

Player: thank you
Sorcerer Estrella: Didn't see THAT one coming. You're welcome.

Player: yes
Sorcerer Estrella: Be aware that this decision is final, Player! Step in front of me and announce it proudly: DO YOU WANT TO BE A SORCERER?

Player: yes
Sorcerer Estrella: SO BE IT! Rise and feel the power, sorcerer Player! Learn the words of your first three spells: 'UTEVO LUX', 'EXURA' and 'EXORI MIN FLAM'! Light, light healing, Apprentice's strike, ...

Sorcerer Estrella: You may cast it by saying the magic words 'UTEVO LUX', 'EXURA' or 'EXORI MIN FLAM' while you have enough mana. Also, you have earned the right to enter the cellar of this house. What you find inside the chests there, is yours to take. ...

Sorcerer Estrella: Equip yourself well and gather some experience in the caves below. You may stay there for a while, but you should leave for the main continent soon. ...

Sorcerer Estrella: The captain on the ship to the north will bring you to a city of your choice when you are prepared. Farewell, young sorcerer, and don't hesitate to ask me if you have any questions.

Player: women
Sorcerer Estrella: NO! Or well - maybe that's true for really strong and well-known sorcerers, who, however, still need to buy runes. Do not hope for too many women, but still, I'd like to ask you whether you think you might enjoy being a sorcerer, yes or no?

Player: parallel dimensions
Spectulus: To explain the infinity of parallel dimensions, please imagine the following. ...

Spectulus: We are currently at a specific point in the flow of time. Let's call it point ZERO at 12:00 o'clock. ...

Spectulus: As time flows I might drop my pencil to the ground - so the flow of time and the events chained to it have gone in direction ONE which leads to 12:01 o'clock with a dropped pencil. ...

Spectulus: Now let's go back to point ZERO. I might also have just put it back into my pocket - the flow of time and its chain of events would have taken a 'different' direction, direction TWO - which leads to a 12:01 o'clock where I never dropped my pencil. ...

Spectulus: Now imagine that 'both' directions actually exist - but you are only aware of one chain of events that has happened. The one where I dropped the pencil. And this is 'your' dimension, the one you are bound to. ...

Spectulus: One 'parallel' dimension would be where the chain of events went in direction TWO. The pencil has been put into my pocket. ...

Spectulus: Now imagine that there is an endless amount of ZERO points, maybe at 12:00 o'clock and one second, or at 12:00 o'clock and two seconds - each from which time can take any possible and probably impossible direction. ...

Spectulus: And whatever direction a chain of events takes, there will always be an infinite amount of points in time from which new events can take completely different directions, creating completely different dimensions of time. ...

Spectulus: Now you might have a better picture of the infinity of dimensions.

Player: wisdom
Spirit Speaker: WISDOM! Such a desirable thing, isn't it? You have come to the right place, I have much knowledge to share about the world you live in, more than you could ever imagine. ...

Spirit Speaker: But not everyone was born to possess great wisdom, especially when they intend to use it as a tool of destruction. Like Ferumbras for example, who used his immense power to call upon great demons to lay havoc on the city of Thais.

Player: hi
Stan: YOU DARE TALKING TO ME, MORTAL?!! ... Relax, it's just a costume. Welcome to Stan's!

Player: costume
Stan: Making these costumes is not as easy as it seems. Have you ever asked yourself how an adult human fits into a dwarf costume? Well, you won't learn it from me! ...

Stan: Otherwise everyone opens up a costume shop ruining my life AGAIN! Anyway I can offer you costumes in three categories: 'common', 'uncommon' or 'deluxe'. Which category are you interested in?

Player: rumour
Stan: There are rumours about people getting killed while wearing my costumes. There was this toothless guy, can't remember his name, he bought a demon costume and then started running around screaming ...

Stan: 'YOUR SOUL WILL BE MINE!'. Don't be surprised if you get killed when you act that stupid.

Player: costume
Stan: Making these costumes is not as easy as it seems. Have you ever asked yourself how an adult human fits into a dwarf costume? Well, you won't learn it from me! ...

Player: sunken quarter
Tarak: Now that's some story. I've told it numerous times to tourists - <coughs>, I mean, adventurers - but it still makes me shiver each time. ...

Tarak: As you might have already noticed, Yalahar is huge. HUGE. The city has grown so much over the past centuries that eventually there was no space left for new buildings. ...

Tarak: However, due to the constant flow of immigrants, the citizens just kept on building and building - either placing buildings on top of each other or trying to enhance the space with platforms on the water. ...

Tarak: Then, a few decades ago, there was a day which I still remember vividly, because I was right in the middle of the whole disaster happening. ...

Tarak: I just came back from the centre and was on the way to my house located in the east quarter - today situated several feet below us under the ocean surface. ...

Tarak: Suddenly the earth was shaking and I heard a loud rumbling. I was still wondering what on earth was going on, or if we were under attack, when I saw the houses closest to the ocean collapse. ...

Tarak: Just like that! The ground under them broke away and fell into the ocean, and then - imagine that - like a wave of destruction, terror rushed through the whole quarter. ...

Tarak: I heard people screaming and more houses tumbling down, and immediately I rushed back to the centre, behind the solid city walls - even though they didn't seem so solid at that time, but it was the safest place I could get to. ...

Tarak: From there I had to helplessly watch how the whole quarter fell apart. Large chunks of stone and earth collapsed into the ocean, and with them all of my belongings. ...

Tarak: When the wave of destruction reached the wall separating the quarter from the other parts of the city, that wall also sunk into the ocean and must have worked as a barrier down there. ...

Tarak: You can still see the top of the old wall sticking out of the water. After that last collapse, the destruction stopped all of a sudden. ...

Tarak: Only a few people, among them myself as you can see, were able to survive the great downfall. The rest was buried under their houses, or drowned in the ocean. Such cruel fate... ...

Tarak: Well, <clears throat> it took a while for me to recover from that incident, and afterwards I decided to show to adventurers what can happen when you foolishly overestimate your power. So let that be a lesson to you. ...

Tarak: Now, it's up to you if you want to dive down to the remains of the sunken part of Yalahar. You need a Helmet of the Deep, though. And beware, quara have infested the area. ...

Tarak: Maybe they were also involved into the great downfall. We will never know for sure, but I truly hope an incident like that won't repeat itself in Yalahar.

Player: hi / hello

Trimegis: These stupid Kingsday festivities are the worst idea I've ever seen. Especially because drunk mundanes run through MY room all the time. I prefer to hide in the execution archives.

Turvy: Thais is OK - I suppose. Not as nice as Venore, but good for business.

Player: Monster
Turvy: There is a monster here? HERE?! Time to double the prices!

Player: yes
Tylius: <chuckles> Good. We magic wielders prefer to fight from a distance, as our defense and armor is a lot weaker than that of the knights. But we deal out more damage with a hit than they do. ...

Tylius: Stay at a little distance from a monster. Too far away: the staff won't hit the monster; come too close and the monster will hit YOU. ...

Tylius: First, drag your staff to the weapon slot in your inventory to use it. Then, to attack, RIGHT-CLICK on a monster on the screen or battle list and choose 'ATTACK'. ...

Tylius: Remember that a staff also needs mana to work, so make sure you always have some food, or you won't regenerate mana. There's food in the chest outside, and some blueberry bushes. Oh yes, one other thing: mana will only be regenerated inside tents. ...

Tylius: Ready for the staff?

Player: again
Tylius: Gladly. We magic wielders prefer to fight from a distance, as our defense and armor is a lot weaker than that of the knights. But we deal out more damage with a hit than they do. ...

Tylius: Stay at a little distance from a monster. Too far away: the staff won't hit the monster; come too close and the monster will hit YOU. ...

Tylius: Drag your staff to the weapon slot in your inventory to use it, right-click on a monster and choose 'attack'. ...

Tylius: Check your mana and always have some food with you. When you're done, visit Shanoya next door for more... mundane distance fighting. <chuckles> Enjoy!

Player: no
Tylius: No? <chuckles> OK, we'll proceed as planned, then.

Uncle: I have the privilege to serve as the headman of the AVIN.

Player: AVIN
Uncle: The Agency of Venorean Interest Negotiators is an organisation sponsored by the noble traders of our fair city ...

Uncle: We ensure the safety of our city and it's ventures and we scan the shifting markets and points of interests all over the world ...

Uncle: The field of our operations is broad and we react quite flexibly to the numerous problems that might arise.

Player: CGB
Uncle: The CGB are amateurish patriots. They lack any refinement or subtlety that is necessary in this business ...

Uncle: When you need a fine sharp knife, they come with a chopping axe. But like all fanatics they can become dangerous if you do not monitor them.

Player: TBI
Uncle: They are bureaucrats, content when counting pennies and wasting the king's resources ...

Uncle: All tries to make this humongous organisation more effective have been without success.

Vigintius: How you tried to get out of that hole! Pure comedy, I tell ya. I also know you were a bit afraid of trolls! LOL! Imagine, trolls! ...

Vigintius: And you were scared like mad of orcs: 'Oh, they will kill me! Must get out of here!' Priceless! Don't feel ashamed, man. We all've been there! In the end you turned out quite well I must say! Well, at least you could have turned out worse, man.

Player: king / tibianus
Zoltan: King Tibianus III was the founder of our academy.

Player: yes
Zoltan: So know that destroying the mortal shell of the being called Ferumbras was the best we were able to achieve with our combined efforts in the past. ...

Zoltan: He was destroyed not only once but several times. Eventually we were able to figure out the secret of his seeming immortality. ...

Zoltan: On one of the most remote islands of the Shattered Isles, he built a citadel with demonic aid right around a powerful magical nexus. ...

Zoltan: The only reason for the whole complex was to establish a point of return into our world. Whenever he is slain, his soul retreats to some demonic dimension to regain enough strength to re-enter the world. ...

Zoltan: We were not able to destroy his citadel, this unholy construct. To make matters worse, the nexus makes it easy for demons of all kind to pass into our world. ...

Zoltan: The best thing we could do was to seal the citadel and to install a device that will alarm us whenever Ferumbras tries to re-enter our world. ...

Zoltan: We grant heroes like you the permission to pass our seals and enter Ferumbras' citadel. ...

Zoltan: Just ask for the permission if you are ready to go there. Be warned that the citadel is no holiday place though. You will encounter large amounts of demons and traps that scare off most adventurers. ...

Zoltan: On the other hand, WHEN Ferumbras re-enters the world we need heroes like you to face him on his very own ground before he can escape. ...

Zoltan: His return is not very likely but it can happen each and every day. If you should manage to defeat him, bring a proof of his death here and you will be rewarded.

Player: permission
Zoltan: The attuning to our seals is a costly process and it will grant you access to the citadel ONLY ONCE. Each time you want to enter, you will need a new attuning. Are you willing to pay 500 gold pieces to become attuned to the seal of the citadel?

Player: yes
Zoltan: SO BE IT!
